    <h1>About JAMstack</h1>
    <p>
      The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. Itâ€™s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience. No rendering means greatly reduced attack surface area for malware, ultra fast hosting on CDN, no debugging php or optimizing render times, and a super cheap way to scale your hosting.
